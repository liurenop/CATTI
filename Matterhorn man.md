  现代登山运动员总想找一条能够给他们带来运动乐趣的路线来攀登山峰。他们认为， 道路愈艰险愈带劲儿。然而，在登山运动的初期，全然不是这种情况。早期登山者所寻找的是通往山顶的最方便的途径，因为顶峰特别是前人未曾到过的顶峰 -- 才是他们寻求的目标。确实，在探险中他们经常遇到惊心动魄的困难和危险，而他们装备之简陋足以使现代登山者一想起来就胆战心惊。但是，他们并非故意寻求这种刺激，他们只有一个目标，唯一的目标 -- 顶峰!  
  我们今天很难想像昔日的登山先驱们是多么艰苦。除了泽曼特和夏蒙尼等一两个很快出了名的地方外，阿尔卑斯山山区的小村几乎全是高山环抱、与世隔绝的穷乡僻壤。那里的小客栈一般都很肮脏，而且跳蚤猖獗。 食物是当地的干酪和通常存放了一年之久的面包，人们就着劣酒吞下这种食物。山谷里常常没有小客栈，登山者只好随遇而安。有时同当地牧师 (他通常和他的教民一样穷)住在一起，有时同牧羊人或制乳酪的人住在一起。无论住在哪儿，情况都一样：肮脏、贫穷，极其不舒适。对于过惯了一顿饭吃7道菜、睡亚麻细布床单的人来说，变换一下生活环境来到阿尔卑斯山山区，那一定是很艰难的。

Morden alpmists try to climb mountains by a route which can give them good sports: the harder it is, the higher it is regarded. In the pioneering days, however, it was not the case at all. The earlier climbers were looking for the easiest way to the top, especially if it was never atteneded before, because the summit was the prize they sought. It is true that during their exploration they often faced difficulties and dangers of the most perilous nature, equiped in a manner which would make a morden alpnist shudder at the first thought. But they did not go out of their way to court such excitement. They had a singal aim, a solitory goal -- the top!  
It is impossible today to imagine how hard it was for the pioneers in the early days. Except for one or two places such as Zermat or Chamonix, which had rapidly become popular, the villages around the alps tended to be imporverished settlements cut off from outside civillization by the high mountains. Inns as there were were usually dirty and flea-riden; food, usually local cheese, accompanied by bread of twelve months old, all washed down by course wine. Often a vally boasted no inn at all, the alpnists had to find shelters wherever they could, sometimes with local priest (who usually was as poor as his parishioners), sometimes with local sheperds or cheese-makers. No matter where it was, the background was the same: dirty and poverty, and very uncomfortable. For people accustomered to eating seven-course dinners and sleeping between fine linens, the change to the Alps must be very hard indeed.
